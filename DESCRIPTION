Description: CELTYC is an R package that implements cell type specific
    clustering pipeline given a DNA methylation data matrix. It includes
    the process of estimating cell type fractions within a tissue type,
    identifying disease-associated DMCs altered in specific cell types,
    and unsupervised clustering with the identified DMCTs for different
    cell types.
